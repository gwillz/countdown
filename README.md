# Countdown

Because I'm a nerdy, lazy, and I like to know the answers without actually trying very hard.

Now go and pretend you're smart in front of your partner while watching mindless TV on a school night.


## Web version

## Python version

This reads your local dictionary (on linux) and runs a simple elimination algorithm to find real words from your jumble of letters.

Typically it'll get something in under a second with a 100k word dictionary.

Depending on your dictionary - it'll miss some things like nouns, particular british ones if you're lazy like me and haven't fixed your system.


### Usage

Real simple:

```sh
python3 -m countdown <letters>
```
